# Project Overview

In this project, I covered the full process of building a beginner machine learning project. This included creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. By the end, I understood how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.

To make it interesting, I used a fun dataset. I used data from historical Olympic games to try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which I also followed here. This outline helped me tackle the machine learning problem effectively.

**Project Steps**

1. Formed a hypothesis.
2. Found and explored the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshaped the data to predict my target.
4. Cleaned the data for ML.
5. Picked an error metric.
6. Split my data.
7. Trained a model.
